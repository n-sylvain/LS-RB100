=begin
Define a method that accepts a multi-word string as an argument, and returns a
version of that string with each word reversed. The method should maintain
the position of commas between words and any punctuation on the end of the string

TEST CASES
word_reverse("Howdy howdy howdy") == "ydwoH ydwoh ydwoh"
word_reverse("Reverse Word!") == ' 'esreveR drow!"
word_reverse("Hello, World") == "olleH, dlrow"
word_reverse("Hey Bob, are you there?") == "yeH boB, era uoy ereht?"
word_reverse("Can't stop, won't stop!") == "t'naC pots, t'now pots!"

PEDAC

Problem
  - Input:
    - Multi-word string
  - Output
    - A version of that string with each word reversed in place, maintaining position of punctuation
  - Rules:
    - Explicit:
      - Commas and punctuation at the end of words should not move
      - Input string will contain more than one word
    - Implicit:
      - Letter case should be maintained
      - Apostrophies in the middle of words should move like other characters
      - Does not need to account for numbers
      - The input string can be modified

Examples and Test Cases
  - Test cases all conform to stated rules

Data Structures
  - Array

Algorithm
  - Separate string into an array of words
  - Iterate through array of words, reversing each word
  - If word now starts with punctuation, move it back to the end
    - Iterate through array of reversed words, checking to see if the first
      character is a punctuation.
      - If not, remove the first character and add it to the end
